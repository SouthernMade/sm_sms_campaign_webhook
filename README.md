This gem will help app implementors using [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) setup a webhook to ingest data from Southern Made's SMS campaign service. Processing the data can help with:

- user engagement
- entry tracking
- vote tracking
- data report
- other useful things

Work closely with your Southern Made project manager to gather details about what needs to be tracked, what fields to verify, and which scenarios are expected to be supported!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sm_sms_campaign_webhook'
```

And then execute:

## Usage

Right now, nothing happens! Soon, some useful details will emerge about how to ingest the SMS campaign payloads.

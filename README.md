This gem will help app implementors using [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) setup a webhook to ingest data from Southern Made's SMS campaign service. Processing the data can help with:

- user engagement
- entry tracking
- vote tracking
- data report
- other useful things

Work closely with your Southern Made project manager to gather details about what needs to be tracked, what fields to verify, and which scenarios are expected to be supported!

## Installation

This gem is tested with Rails 5.2.x, 6.0.x versions.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sm_sms_campaign_webhook'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sm_sms_campaign_webhook

## Usage

Right now, nothing happens! Soon, some useful details will emerge about how to ingest the SMS campaign payloads.

### Set Backend for ActiveJob

Payloads will be dispatched and processed asynchronously using [ActiveJob](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_job_basics.html). Southern Made prefers that the app be configured with [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) as the queue adapter.

You can set the adapter in `config/application.rb` with:

```ruby
class Application < Rails::Application
  config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq
end
```

Update your Procfile or appropriate config to launch worker processes:

```
worker: RAILS_MAX_THREADS=${SIDEKIQ_CONCURRENCY:-5} bundle exec sidekiq --config config/sidekiq.yml
```

More detailed instructions about using Sidekiq can be found in the [Sidekiq Wiki](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki).

### Mount the Webhook Engine

Add the following to `config/routes.rb` in your app to mount the webhook:

```ruby
mount SmSmsCampaignWebhook::Engine => "/sms_campaign"
```

This sets the app up to receive POST requests from the SMS campaign service:

    POST /sms_campaign/api/webhook

Be sure to replace `/sms_campaign` with whatever mount point you choose. Once you share the webhook URI with your project manager, avoid changing it; they will configure it with the correspending SMS campaign!

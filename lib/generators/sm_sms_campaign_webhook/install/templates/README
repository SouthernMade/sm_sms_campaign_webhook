Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Set the ENV value SM_SMS_CAMPAIGN_WEBHOOK_AUTH_TOKEN with a Rails secret:

       $ bundle exec rails secret

  2. Mount the webhook engine in config/routes.rb to accept requests.
     For example:

       mount SmSmsCampaignWebhook::Engine => "/sms_campaign"

  3. Prep the app for ActiveJob using Sidekiq. In config/application.rb:

       config.active_job.queue_adapter = :sidekiq

     In Procfile or appropriate app launch config:

       worker: bundle exec sidekiq --config config/sidekiq.yml

  4. Implement SmsPayloadProcessor behavior. Remember, the generated processor
     provides the skeleton but will raise errors out of the box. Data handling
     is app specific!

This will configure the app to be ready to accept SMS campaign service payloads.

Happy hacking!
